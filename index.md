*Computational Biophysics for Medicine in 3D Slicer*

[SlicerCBM](https://github.com/SlicerCBM/SlicerCBM)
is an extension for
[3D Slicer](http://slicer.org)
that provides tools for creating and solving
computational models of biophysical systems and processes
with a focus on clinical and biomedical applications.

## Tutorial

A tutorial to construct a patient-specific brain biomechanical model
for craniotomy-induced brain shift and electrode placement-induced brain shift
can be found
[here](tutorial/tutorial.md).
